## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later**
* **Apache Maven**
* **Node.js and npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Satyam57/Reply-Buddy.git](https://github.com/Satyam57/Reply-Buddy.git)
    cd Reply-Buddy
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    The backend requires API keys or other secrets. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary variables.
    * Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
    * Add your configuration based on the `.env.example` file (it's a good practice to create one!). For example:
        ```
        API_KEY_FOR_AI_SERVICE="your-secret-key-here"
        SERVER_PORT=8080
        ```

3.  **Set Up the Backend (Spring Boot):**
    Open a terminal in the project root and run the Maven command to build the application and install dependencies.
    ```bash
    # This will compile the code and download all required libraries
    mvn clean install
    ```

4.  **Set Up the Frontend (React):**
    Navigate to the React app's directory and install its npm packages.
    ```bash
    # Go into the React app folder
    cd reply-buddy-react

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    From the project's root directory, run the following command:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    Your backend API should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Dev Server:**
    In a **new terminal**, navigate to the React directory and start the Vite development server.
    ```bash
    cd reply-buddy-react
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Load the Browser Extension:**
    * Open your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome).
    * Go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
    * Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
    * Click on **"Load unpacked"**.
    * Select the `reply-buddy-ext` folder from your project directory.
    * The "Reply-Buddy" extension should now appear in your browser's toolbar!
